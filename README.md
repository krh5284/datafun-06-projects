> Practice using the skills we've learned in Python to tell a story with data. diamonds.ipynb is a dataset and steps from the textbook. explore.ipynb is a dataset found on the internet and the analysis I chose to complete. 

## Project 1 - Diamonds Datset

Exercise in the book to practice the fundamentals off loading a dataset through basic matplotlib visualizations

## Project 2 - Exploratory Data Project

Data exploration project of my domain, chickens. The dataset I choose is a nominal food value per dollar dataset from the US Department of Agriculture website that compares the costs of food products (to include poultry and eggs) and the costs associated with getting the food from farm to consumer from 1993 to 2021
